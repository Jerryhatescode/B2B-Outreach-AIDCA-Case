# Part 2: Funnel Debugging

### Mock Funnel Data

| Stage Conversion | Response Rate | Drop-off Reason | Message Summary |
|------------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Lead → MQL (65%) → SQL (15%) → Client (5%) | 40% | Trust not built at SQL | Focused on features, no proof |
| Lead → MQL (25%) → SQL (20%) → Client (10%) | 10% | Weak hook at top | Subject line too vague |
| Lead → MQL (70%) → SQL (45%) → Client (20%) | 60% | Over-engineered | Too much jargon, unclear CTA |

### Diagnosis and Fixes

**Row 1: High MQL, Low SQL**  
- Problem: No trust building.  
- Fix: Add **Conviction (AIDCA)** + **Social Proof + Authority** (cite peers, case study). Keep CTA diagnostic call.  

**Row 2: Low MQL**  
- Problem: Weak subject line.  
- Fix: Stronger **Attention (AIDCA)** with an industry stat. Add **Scarcity** (“Q4 pilot slots left”).  

**Row 3: Good leads, drop later**  
- Problem: Too much jargon, weak CTA.  
- Fix: Simplify to **Desire + Action (AIDCA)**. Use business benefits (time/cost saved). Add **Reciprocity** (offer free dashboard mockup).
