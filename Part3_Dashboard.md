# Part 3: Dashboard Design

I sketched a simple dashboard idea for tracking outreach campaigns. This can be built in Excel, Notion, or Figma.

## Sections

### 1. Funnel Metrics
- Track % conversion: Lead → MQL → SQL → Client
- Add a drop-off heatmap (green = good, red = bad)

### 2. Campaign AIDCA Diagnosis
Table example:

| Campaign | Stage Weakness | Strength | Persuasion Gap |
|----------|----------------|----------|----------------|
| D2C CTO  | Conviction     | Attention | Missing case study |
| Pharma COO | Attention    | Conviction | Weak compliance hook |

### 3. Recommendations
- CTO emails: Add more proof (Social Proof at SQL).  
- Pharma COO emails: Use stronger compliance stats upfront.  

### 4. Leadership Intervention
- Mark where leadership should step in:  
  - Targeting problem = adjust outreach list  
  - Nurturing problem = add more credibility (case studies, testimonials)
